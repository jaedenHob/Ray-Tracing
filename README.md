# Ray Tracing project

## work in progress

## Summary
Hi my name is Jaeden and I am a computer science graduate from the university of central Florida.
This project is simply me working on some computer graphics stuff for fun. The goal is to build 
a ray tracer through webGL. My steps through it is to understand the process through accomplishing
this in a 2D space because of the smaller complexity before my attempt towards a 3D space.

Things I have experimented with in a 2D space was casting out rays as well as math for calculating the
soft shadows from multiple light sources.

Above is the raytracer itself (In progress).

## to install just copy the repo then install the dependencies:

`npm install`
then
