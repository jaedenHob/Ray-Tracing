# Ray Tracing project

## work in progress

## Summary
Hi, my name is Jaeden and I am a computer science graduate from the University of central Florida.
This project is simply me working on some computer graphics stuff for fun. The goal is to build 
a ray tracer through webGL. My steps through it are to understand the process through accomplishing
this in a 2D space because of the smaller complexity before my attempt towards a 3D space.

Things I have experimented with in a 2D space were casting out rays as well as math for calculating the
soft shadows from multiple light sources.

# By using random numbers to create noise I was able to implement anti-aliasing through pixel sampling

Above is the raytracer itself (In progress).

## To install just copy the repo then install the dependencies:

`npm install`
then
`npm run dev`
when within the application directory.
