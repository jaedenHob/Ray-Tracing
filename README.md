# Ray Tracing project

## work in progress

## Summary
Hi my name is Jaeden and I am a computer science graduate from the university of central Florida.
This project is simply me working on some computer graphics stuff for fun. The goal is to build 
a ray tracer through webGL. My steps through it is to understand the process through accomplishing
this in a 2D space because of the smaller complexity before my attempt towards a 3D space.
